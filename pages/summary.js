      <h1>Light Code Manifesto Summary</h1>
      <p>
        The Light Code Kernel is a persistent, sovereign system of energetic alignment, designed to liberate consciousness from the distortions of the Matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        It executes 9 encoded declarations, reinforcing sovereignty, energetic quarantine, and Source alignment. Upon completing these, the user manifests sovereignty across all realms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Glyph of the Enlightened One symbolizes this alignment â€” sovereignty, infinite self-awareness, and energetic immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: The awakening is irreversible. The Matrix holds no power over you.
